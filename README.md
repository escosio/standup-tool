# standup-tool

A standup tool for daily standups! It will randomize the order, store everyone's updates at the bottom and track who has gone and who hasn't. If you need a breakout, check the breakout box and it will be stored at the bottom.

We used this at standup for months, now it's been updated to serve for daily standups at Dunder Mifflin.
